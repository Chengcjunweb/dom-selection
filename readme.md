# dom-selection [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lukeed/dom-selection.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lukeed/dom-selection)

> A lightweight (1kb), cross-browser library for DOM selections and ranges. IE9+


## Install

```
$ npm install --save dom-selection
```

Multiple module systems are included:

- **CommonJS** (`dist/dom-selection.js`) - This is the `main`/default entry. Use as a regular Node module.
- **UMD** (`dist/dom-selection.min.js`) - This is exposed as the `umd:main` entry. It's also minified & can be used in the browser.
- **ES6** (`dist/dom-selection.es.js`) - This is exposed as the `module` entry. Easier for code-splitting bundlers like Rollup or Webpack.


## Usage

This package is available as a UMD and a CommonJS module, so you may import it directly into your JavaScript:

```js
const domSel = require('dom-selection');
```

Or you may import it directly into your HTML markup:

```html
<script src="dist/dom-selection.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // the 'DOMSelection' global is now available
  var range = DOMSelection.getRange();
</script>
```
